Create quick tables to throw data up into your website's REST API.

== Description ==

Sometimes you just want to throw some basic data up on your site's REST API. Perhaps you have an application that uses WordPress as the backend. Or maybe you're doing a custom theme for a client and you want an easy place for them to edit repeatable data. 

Rest Data Tables - little tables that output all of their data into the REST API.

This information will not be shown anywhere on the front end of the site, unless you include the shortcode in a post or page. 

Examples: 
* A short directory or phone book
* A record or log

== Installation ==

1. Upload `cb-rest-data-tables.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Create a new table.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why did you make this plugin? =

I use WordPress as a backend to a mobile app, but not all of the data I want displayed fits into the Post or Page format. I like having all of my data coming from the same place, so I realized it would be easier if I could just input data into a few simple tables to be retrieved by my app.

= Can you also edit the data via the REST API? =

No. This may come in some future plugin but not as of now.
